# due 11/5 at midnight (11:59:59PM) - postponed 11/12 at midnight

Finish notebook on clustering "INSTRUCTIONS Kaggle Customer Profile DBscan" (as per this folder)

Note: in the notebook there are cells of code where plots are made - keep the code and run the cell. The plots may differ somewhat form the ones I made (depending for exaple on the hyperparameters of the DBscan model you used). 

ADD CAPTIONS TO ALL FIGURES: this includes the figures you create original code for and the figures that I left code for in the notebook

IMPORTANT: justify the hyperparameters you choose in a text cell below the model design cell
