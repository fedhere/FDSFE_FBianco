Part 1: find a bad plot and a good plot by looking through papers on https://journals.plos.org/plosone to an external site.
.   Download the image or screenshot it and post it to your HW7 README.md. The README.md should contain each of the two images, a description of why it is good/bad based on the criteria discussed in class for data and scientific visualizations. https://slides.com/federicabianco/fdsfe_10/edit


What is wrong with it:
-  ambiguity

-  distortion

-  distraction
Is it respecting the 5 Tufte’s rules:
- effect size ~ 1: The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graph itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented   (“lie factor”)
- data/ink >> 1: Clear, detailed and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity.  Write out explanations of the data on the graph itself.  Label important events in the data
- no chart junk: Show data variation, not design variation
- use small-multiples if comparisons are to be made In time-series displays of money, deflated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.
- avoid redundancy in communication: The number of information carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data. Graphics must not quote data out of context.


Part 2: take a plot from any of the homeworks and redesign it to improve it. Post the old version and the new version on the same README and discuss the changes you made, the reason for them, and how they improve the plot. Make sure the caption of the final plot is complete: include WHAT is being plotted and how to allow the reader to understand the plot and WHY its being plotted: what is interesting, what is noticeable about the data/result.


Part 3: next week your plots will be assigned to two classmates for review (HW8)
